Ethereum ProgPoW, an ethereum node client created for miners and decentralized network

## What is Ethereum ProgPoW?

[Ethereum ProgPoW](https://ethereumprogpow.com) is an alternative ethereum node software to provide minerâ€™s voting tool for secure, decentralized network against potential ASIC threat. By adopting ProgPoW, a Programmatic Proof-of-Work extension for Ethash algorithm, Ethereum ProgPoW can fulfill its vision to support sustainable, scalable network operation under transparent open source development.

## Building the source

Building geth requires both a Go (version 1.9 or later) and a C compiler. (For ubuntu install build-essential and golang-1.10-go from apt package manager)
You can install them using your favourite package manager.
Once the dependencies are installed, run

    make geth

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

    make all

## Executables

The ethereumprogpow project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd` directory.

| Command    | Description |
|:----------:|-------------|
| **`geth`** | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/ethereumprogpow/ethereumprogpow/wiki/Command-Line-Options) for command line options. |

## Running geth

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/ethereumprogpow/ethereumprogpow/wiki/Command-Line-Options)), but we've
enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly on how you can run your
own Geth instance.

### Full node on the main Ethereum (ProgPoW) network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum network:
create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this particular use-case
the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can fast-sync quickly to the current
state of the network. To do so:

```
$ geth
```

This command will:

 * Start geth in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag), causing it to
   download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history of the Ethereum network,
   which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start up Geth's built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://github.com/ethereumprogpow/ethereumprogpow/wiki/JavaScript-Console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)
   as well as Geth's own [management APIs](https://github.com/ethereumprogpow/ethereumprogpow/wiki/Management-APIs).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running Geth instance
   with `geth attach`.

### Full node on the Gangnam ProgPoW test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you'd like to play around with creating Ethereum contracts, you
almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until you get the hang of the
entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main network, you want to join the **test**
network with your node, which is fully equivalent to the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```
$ geth --gangnam
```

The `console` subcommand have the exact same meaning as above and they are equally useful on the
testnet too. Please see above for their explanations if you've skipped to here.

Specifying the `--testnet` flag however will reconfigure your Geth instance a bit:

 * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.ethereum` on Linux for example), Geth will nest
   itself one level deeper into a `testnet` subfolder (`~/.ethereum/testnet` on Linux). Note, on OSX
   and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node requires the use of a custom
   endpoint since `geth attach` will try to attach to a production node endpoint by default. E.g.
   `geth attach <datadir>/testnet/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by this.
 * Instead of connecting the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the test network,
   which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis states.

*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from crossing
over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always use separate accounts
for play-money and real-money. Unless you manually move accounts, Geth will by default correctly
separate the two networks and will not make any accounts available between them.*

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a configuration file via:

```
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to export your existing configuration:

```
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

*Note: This works only with geth v1.6.0 and above.*

#### Docker quick start

One of the quickest ways to get Ethereum up and running on your machine is by using Docker:

```
docker run -d --name ethereum-node -v /Users/alice/ethereumprogpow:/root \
           -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \
           ethereumprogpow/ethereumprogpow
```

This will start geth in fast-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB just as the above command does.  It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an `alpine` tag available for a slim version of the image.

Do not forget `--rpcaddr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers and/or hosts. By default, `geth` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints is not accessible from the outside.

### Programatically interfacing Geth nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with Geth and the Ethereum
network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid this, Geth has built-in
support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) and
[Geth specific APIs](https://github.com/ethereumprogpow/ethereumprogpow/wiki/Management-APIs)). These can be
exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (unix sockets on unix based platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by Geth, whereas the HTTP
and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a subset of APIs due to security reasons.
These can be turned on/off and configured as you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--rpc` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--rpcaddr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: "localhost")
  * `--rpcport` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: 8545)
  * `--rpcapi` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: "eth,net,web3")
  * `--rpccorsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--wsaddr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: "localhost")
  * `--wsport` WS-RPC server listening port (default: 8546)
  * `--wsapi` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: "eth,net,web3")
  * `--wsorigins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: "admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3")
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to connect
via HTTP, WS or IPC to a Geth node configured with the above flags and you'll need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
on all transports. You can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based transport before
doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs!
Further, all browser tabs can access locally running webservers, so malicious webpages could try to
subvert locally available APIs!**

## Development Process

This Github repository contains the source code of releases.

At the early stage in Ethereum ProgPoW's development, we won't often make changes and updates to our codebase as an effort to serve our client as stable as possible.

We expect this to change in the future.
